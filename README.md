# DeVeFi ICP Ledger Middleware

Check https://github.com/Neutrinomic/devefi_icrc_ledger
This is the ICP ledger version. Under development.
The ICP ledger is different, because its history doesn't contain {owner; subaccount}, but their hash instead.
This requires all used canister subaccounts to be explicitly registered before transactions happen - to get tracked.
